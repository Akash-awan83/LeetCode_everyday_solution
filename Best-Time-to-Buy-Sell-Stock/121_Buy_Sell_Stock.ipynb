    "# LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 1:**\n",
    "- **Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`\n",
    "- **Output:** `5`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = $6-1 = 5$.\n",
    "- **Note:** Profit cannot be $7-1 = 6$ because you must buy before you sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Constraints:**\n",
    "- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Approach 1: Brute Force**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Logic**\n",
    "In this approach, we try every possible pair of buying and selling days. We use two nested loops:\n",
    "1. The **Outer Loop** iterates through each day as a potential buying day.\n",
    "2. The **Inner Loop** iterates through all subsequent days as potential selling days.\n",
    "3. We calculate the difference for every pair and keep track of the maximum profit found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$\n",
    "  - Since we are using two nested loops, for an input size of $n$, we perform approximately $n^2/2$ operations.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$\n",
    "  - We are not using any extra data structures, only a few variables to store the profit.\n"

    "\n",
    "### **Logic**\n",
    "This is the most efficient and industry-standard way to solve the problem. Instead of re-scanning or using multiple pointers, we solve it in a **single pass** through the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Strategy:**\n",
    "1. We keep track of the **Minimum Price** seen so far as we iterate through the list.\n",
    "2. For every new price, we check:\n",
    "   - \"Is this the lowest price so far?\" (If yes, update `min_price`).\n",
    "   - \"If I sell today, is this my maximum profit?\" (If yes, update `max_profit`).\n",

    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$\n",
    "  - We only store two variables (`min_price` and `max_profit`), so it uses constant memory.\n"

    "## **Approach 2: Two Pointers (Sliding Window)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Logic**\n",
    "The Brute Force method is slow because it re-scans the array multiple times. We can optimize this by using **Two Pointers**:\n",
    "1. **Left Pointer (`L`)**: Represents the day we buy the stock.\n",
    "2. **Right Pointer (`R`)**: Represents the day we sell the stock.\n",

    "- We start with `L = 0` and `R = 1`.\n",
    "- If the price at `L` is **less** than at `R`, it means there is a potential profit. we calculate the profit and update our `max_profit`.\n",
    "- If the price at `R` is **less** than at `L`, it means we found a new **lowest price**. In this case, we move our `L` pointer to the `R` position because buying at this new price will always be better for future transactions.\n",
    "- We increment the `R` pointer in every step until we reach the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$\n",
    "  - We only iterate through the array once using the `right` pointer. Even though the `left` pointer moves, it never goes backward, ensuring linear time.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$\n",
    "  - We only use a few variables (`left`, `right`, `max_profit`) regardless of the input size.\n"
