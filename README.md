# LeetCode Everyday Solution: The Multi-Approach Method
### Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms through Depth and Analysis

Welcome to my daily DSA journal. This repository is not just a collection of solutions; it is a detailed log of my problem-solving journey. I believe that solving one problem in three different ways is more valuable than solving three problems in one way.

## My 3-Lens Philosophy
Every problem in this repository is analyzed and solved using three distinct approaches:

1. Brute Force (Intuition):
   - The first logical approach that comes to mind.
   - Focuses on understanding the core problem without worrying about efficiency.

2. Optimized (Better):
   - Refining the logic using better Data Structures (HashMaps, Two Pointers, etc.).
   - Aiming for better Time and Space complexity.

3. The Gold Standard (Efficient):
   - The most optimized industry-standard solution.
   - Best possible Time and Space complexity for the given constraints.

## Repository Structure
Each problem has its own dedicated directory to keep things organized:

```text
Problem-Folder/
├── README.md       <-- Detailed breakdown & complexity analysis of 3 approaches
└── solution.py     <-- Clean, documented Python
